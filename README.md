# Self-Driving-Arduino-Car
Beginnings of Arduino Car v3.0

## Purpose
Arduino released a new chip for the 2019 calender year: the Arduino Nano Ble 33. It is one of the few chips that can support Tensorflow Lite. Having done a data science co-op just a month prior, I thought it would be appropriate to use some of these machine-learning skills to create a self-driving car. This project is completely meant to show off random skills such as visualization skills and deep-learning skills. 

Skills to learn:
- Tensorflow on a microcontroller
- 3D printing with a resin SLA printer (Photon S)
- (Build on) visualization skills 
- (Build on) electronic skills
- Have fun
